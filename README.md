# ASCENDING Python demo by James Whyte
This project serves as a demostration of using SAM AWS for ASCENDING to delpoy a serverless hello-world application.

## Usage
The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS.

A serverless application is a combination of:
- Lambda functions
- Event source
- CloudFormation template
- Test

Note: SAM is more than just a Lambda functionâ€”it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings.

## Application
The sample application provides a REST API (with API Gateway) with a single endpoint. When this endpoint is requested, a Lambda function is triggered.

## Prerequisites
Creating AWS account, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions, and installatiion of SAM CLI required deployment.

## Containerization (optional)

For sandboxing and testing on local machine one can use a docker image.

## Deloy
You can deploy the application to AWS with the SAM CLI:

```python
#Step 1 - Download a sample application
sam init

#Step 2 - Build your application
cd sam-app
sam build

#Step 3 - Deploy your application
sam deploy --guided
```

## Critical files
```
template.yaml: Contains the AWS SAM template that defines your application's AWS resources.

hello_world/app.py: Contains your actual Lambda handler logic.

hello_world/requirements.txt: Contains any Python dependencies that the application requires, and is used for sam build.
```
# SAM Packaging
This command creates a .zip file of your code and dependencies, and uploads the file to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS SAM enables encryption for all files stored in Amazon S3. It then returns a copy of your AWS SAM template, replacing references to local artifacts with the Amazon S3 location where the command uploaded the artifacts.

Create an S3 bucket on AWS console to link with your project.

We can use the following command:
sam package [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

I replaced ```[OPTIONS] [ARGS]``` with ```-t``` followed by the path where my AWS SAM template is located, as well as ```--s3-bucket``` followed by the name of the S3 created on my AWS console, ```--output-template-file``` followed by the path to the file where the command writes the packaged template. 

## Key files
- hello_world - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

## Tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the test dependencies and run tests.

```bash
python-demo$ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt --user
# unit test
python-demo$ python -m pytest tests/unit -v
# integration test, requiring deploying the stack first.
# Create the env variable AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME with the name of the stack we are testing
python-demo$ AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME=<stack-name> python -m pytest tests/integration -v
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name python-demo
```
